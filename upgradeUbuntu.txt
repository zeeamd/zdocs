Before starting the upgrade process we need to ensure we have the minimum required space left in the root volume of the instance.

Minimum space required - 5GB

Create an AMI of the instance as a backup

Upgrade from 16.04 to 20.04
Verify what is the service that is running on the box
ps -aux | grep <service>

Note down all the services
apt update
apt upgrade
apt dist-upgrade
do-release-upgrade -c (to check the available release version)
do-release-upgrade (to start the upgrade)
In this step, it will ask for a few questions related to upgrading please select the appropriate choise.
After the upgrade process will ask to reboot the instance.
After reboot verify the upgraded OS version 
lsb_release -a

Check the mount point of ephemeral folder using df -h and if it is not there please mount it.
mount -o discard /dev/xvdb /mnt/ephemeral/
service xxxxx restart
Now start all the service that you found running with ps -aux command on the first step.
eg.  service xxxxx start
service xxxxx start

Upgrade 18.04 to 20.04
Follow all the above steps again.
